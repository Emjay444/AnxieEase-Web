# Fix for Appointments Showing as Expired Too Early

## Problem
Appointments scheduled for 4:00 PM on October 17, 2025 were showing as "Expired" even though it was only 3:48 AM on the same day.

## Root Cause
The appointment was **already marked as "expired" in the database** by the old logic that compared dates instead of times. Even though we fixed the logic to compare actual times, the database still had the old "expired" status.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Auto-Fix Function
Created `fixWronglyExpiredAppointments()` function that automatically reverts appointments that were incorrectly marked as expired.

**Logic:**
- Checks all appointments with status = "expired"
- If the appointment_date is in the **future** (after current time)
- Automatically reverts status back to "requested"
- Clears the auto-expiration message

### 2. Integrated Into Load Flow
The fix runs automatically every time appointments are loaded:

```javascript
async getAppointmentsByPsychologist(userId) {
  // 1. Load appointments from database
  // 2. Fix wrongly expired appointments (NEW!)
  // 3. Auto-complete past scheduled appointments
  // 4. Auto-expire past pending requests
  // 5. Return corrected appointments
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging
Added console logging to track what's happening:
- Logs when checking each appointment
- Shows appointment date vs current time
- Indicates which appointments are being fixed

## How It Works

### Before (Broken)
```
3:48 AM: Load appointments
└─ Appointment at 4:00 PM is marked "expired" in DB
└─ Display shows "Expired" ❌
```

### After (Fixed)
```
3:48 AM: Load appointments
├─ Step 1: Found appointment marked "expired"
├─ Step 2: Check if 4:00 PM > 3:48 AM? YES (future)
├─ Step 3: Revert status to "requested"
├─ Step 4: Update database
└─ Display shows "Requested" ✓
```

## Files Modified

### `/src/services/appointmentService.js`

**New Function Added:**
```javascript
async fixWronglyExpiredAppointments(appointments) {
  // Finds appointments with:
  // - status = "expired"
  // - appointment_date in the future
  // Then reverts them to "requested"
}
```

**Modified Function:**
```javascript
async getAppointmentsByPsychologist(userId) {
  // Added call to fixWronglyExpiredAppointments() before other auto-updates
  const fixedAppointments = await this.fixWronglyExpiredAppointments(appointments);
}
```

**Enhanced Logging in:**
- `updatePastPendingAppointmentsToExpired()` - Now logs each check with timestamps

## Testing

After refreshing the browser, the appointment should show as:
- ✓ Status: "Requested" (not "Expired")
- ✓ Can still be approved/declined
- ✓ Shows in calendar with correct color

## Database Cleanup (Optional)

If you want to manually fix all wrongly expired appointments in the database, run:

```sql
-- See fix_expired_appointments.sql for full cleanup script
UPDATE public.appointments
SET 
    status = 'requested',
    response_message = NULL,
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE status = 'expired'
  AND appointment_date > NOW();
```

## Future Prevention

The fix is now **automatic** - if any appointment gets wrongly marked as expired again:
1. It will be detected on next page load
2. Status will be automatically corrected
3. User will see the correct status

## Console Output Example

When loading the page, you should see:
```
Found wrongly expired appointment abc123: {
  appointmentDate: "2025-10-17T08:00:00.000Z",  // 4:00 PM Manila
  now: "2025-10-16T19:48:00.000Z",              // 3:48 AM Manila
  willRevert: true
}
Reverting 1 wrongly expired appointments back to requested status
```

## Status Flow Chart

```
Appointment Created
    ↓
[requested] ← You are here now (after fix)
    ↓
(Psychologist approves)
    ↓
[scheduled]
    ↓
(Time passes - after 4:00 PM)
    ↓
[completed] (auto-marked)
```

## What Changed

| Time | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 3:48 AM | Expired ❌ | Requested ✓ |
| 4:01 PM | Expired ✓ | Expired ✓ |

The fix ensures appointments only expire **after** their scheduled time, not before!
